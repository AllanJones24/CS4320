In my grid, I examined multiple ethical quandaries and different systems that these ethical quandaries might have affected based off the Cambridge Analytica case. In this case, they used data obtained from facebook to build voter profiles. At a glance, the case seems ethically wrong but I wanted to see which specific systems are impacted and is there another side to it. The first issue that pops up is the personal privacy violation.

From these privacy leaks, the biggest people affected were the users on facebook. The way this data was gathered, through using fake accounts and quizzes definatley had an impact on public outlook, once it was uncovered. Facebook obviously had a big role in this process because it was on there platform, where there was minimal monitoring. After the selling of the data, this is when the election and voters get mixed in. Although there wasnt a big change in the election, the election and people involved were still affected. On the other hand, The data could only be collected from peopel who decided to take the quiz. It was an unethical way to gather data for a purpose, but facebook and its users also need to take responsibility in what they partake in.
